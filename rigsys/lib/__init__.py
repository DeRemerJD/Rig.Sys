"""Helper classes and functions for rig building.

The difference between the utils submodule and the lib submodule is that the utils submodule contains utilities that are
developer-centric, while the lib submodule contains utilities that are Maya-centric. For example, the utils submodule
contains a function to unload modules, while the lib submodule contains classes and functions for constructing joints,
proxies, controls, etc.
